1. Waterfall
- is a linear project management approach where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next, with little flexibility for changes.

1. Agile 
- is a flexible project management approach that focuses on iterative development, where work is done in small, manageable stages (sprints) with    continuous feedback and adaptation.
    - `Scrum` is an Agile framework for managing projects. It divides work into small, time-boxed periods called sprints (2-4 weeks). Teams hold    daily meetings to track progress and solve issues.

            1. Sprint Planning:
                - Purpose: To plan the work for the upcoming sprint.
                - What happens: The team and the Product Owner decide which tasks (from the product backlog) will be worked on during the sprint.
                - Outcome: A Sprint Backlog that lists the tasks for the sprint.
            1. Daily Standup (or Daily Scrum):
                - Purpose: To check the team's progress and identify any obstacles.
                - What happens: Each team member answers three questions:
                    - What did I do yesterday?
                    - What will I do today?
                    - Do I have any blockers?
                - Outcome: A clear understanding of the team's status and any issues to address.
            1. Sprint Review:
               - Purpose: To review the work completed during the sprint.
               - What happens: The team demonstrates the completed work to the Product Owner and stakeholders for feedback.
               - Outcome: Feedback is gathered, and the product backlog is updated as needed.
            1. Sprint Retrospective:
                - Purpose: To reflect on the sprint and improve processes.
                - What happens: The team discusses what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how to improve in the next sprint.
                - Outcome: Actionable improvements for the next sprint.
